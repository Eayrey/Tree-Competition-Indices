# Tree-Competition-Indices
Several competition and structural indices for working with forest stem maps in R.

Complexity_Indices.R contains implementations of the following:
-Simpson Species Diversity Index
-Simpson Diameter Index (by dclass)
-GINI index based on diameters
-TD diameter differentiation index
-Mingling Index
-Clark-Evans spatial distribution index

Monte_Carlo_CSR.r assesses spatial randomness of tree spatial distributions from a stem map
-Using monte carlo simulations with randomly placed trees, an assessment is made of whether trees are evenly spaced, randomly spaced, or clustered.

Warning: I implemented these on a whim. Their results have not been checked against any known values.
